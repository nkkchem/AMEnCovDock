#Automated Computational Modeling Engine for Non Covalent Molecular Dockin
########Qvina Automation steps####

Environment:
Constance

module load python/anaconda3.2019.3
source /share/apps/python/anaconda3.2019.3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
conda activate gschnet

Required Files:
	Receptor: pdbqt format
		modify automate.sh to hold this name
	Ligands: csv format
		ID,SMILES
		modify automate.sh to hold this name

	modify line 14 of dock.sh to point to your copy of qvina
    	VINA="/path/to/qvina/bin/qvina02"

	modify run.sbatch to reflect desired sbatch parameters


ANALYSIS
Once the run is completed, we can extract the binding affinities and sort them from highest to smallest. 
	Run these commands in the root directory
		cat docked_proteins/results/run_* > docked_proteins/results/runs
		sort -t, -nk2 docked_proteins/results/runs > docked_proteins/scores	
	docked_proteins/scores will have the list of commands in sorted order with their binding affinities
	docked_proteins/docked will have the docked compounds in docked format which is same as pdbqt
